# IS_FE03
3rd Assignment - Semantics Interoperabity ( IS )

## Objective

The assignment's goals are:

1. Create a Centralized Repository of Scientific Publishings made available by ORCID, which retrieves all the Publishings associated to a certain ORCID. To do this, we made 2 ways available:
- **Real Time** Fetch
- **Backoffice** Fetch, in which, all the information regarding the publishings are first inserted into a database and are then made available to be freely consulted.

2. Do a complexity study in which we look into the times required by each Fetch so that we can better understand where the time is spent and how to possibly improve the System efficiency.
